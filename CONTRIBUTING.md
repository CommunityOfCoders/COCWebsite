# Contributing to COCWebsite
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPL 3.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPL 3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CommunityOfCoders/COCWebsite/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CommunityOfCoders/COCWebsite/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We have prettier in the client-side, and we prefer to have a consistent code format.

* You can try running `npm run format` or have `husky` done that for you in a pre-commit git hook for style unification.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GNU GPL 3.0 License.
